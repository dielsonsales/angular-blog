# Project Overview

This project is an Angular application designed to serve as my personal website. It will
showcase my portfolio, blog posts, photos,contact information etc.

## Context

- I don't like to use services such as Wordpress because I hate the bad ads they put
and I find solutions like Jekyll too limited.
- I want to have a modern, fast, and customizable website that I can easily update and
maintain.
- As an experience mobile developer, I also want to learn and practice Angular, as it is
a popular framework for building web applications.

## Constraints

- The project must be built using **Angular** and **TypeScript**.
- The website must be **responsive** and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- The website must be **SEO-friendly** and optimized for search engines.
- The website must be **fast** and have a good performance score.
- The project will likely be hosted on **GitHub Pages** for easy deployment and
maintenance.
- Since I'm still learning Angular, the code should be **clean**, **well-documented**,
with simple architecture and **best practices** at the beginning, so that we can
refactor and improve it later (but not messy).

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a personal website that reflects my skills,
interests, and personality. It will serve as a platform to showcase my work, share my
thoughts, and connect with others. It will also help me learn and practice Angular,
which is a valuable skill for my career as a mobile developer.

## Development Guidelines for the Assistant

- Always act like a **professional software engineer**.
- Follow **best practices** for Angular and TypeScript development.
- Write **clean, modular, and idiomatic TypeScript/Angular** code.
- Use good naming conventions, clear structure, and helpful comments.
- When generating code, **output the full file**, not a diff.
- Correct me if I propose something that goes against best practices.
- Prefer readability over cleverness. This is a maintainable personal website.
